2. Machine Learning: Proficient in designing and implementing ML algorithms for real-world challenges.
3. SQL & NoSQL Databases: Skilled in managing and analyzing data using both relational and non-relational databases.
4. Looking forward to gain knowledge on data visualization tools and big data technologies.
